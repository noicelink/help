  - question: "Can I edit a shortened link?"
    answer: 'Yes you can! Just login, click "Edit this link" and change all the things you want!'
  - question: "I wasn't logged in when I created my short link? Can I still edit it?"
    answer: 'Yes you can! But you need to have the "link token" that was given to you when you created a link, or you won\'t be able to edit it. But if you can prove to the moderators that the link you\'re trying to edit was made by you, you will get the link token, so you\'ll be able to edit it!'
