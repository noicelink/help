questions:
  - question: "Can I edit a shortened link?"
    answer: 'Yes you can! Just login with Discord, click "Edit this link" and change all the things you want!'
  - question: "I wasn't logged in when I created my short link? Can I still edit it?"
    answer: 'Yes you can! But you need to have the "link token" that was given to you when you created a link, or you won\'t be able to edit it. But if you can prove to the moderators that the link you\'re trying to edit was made by you, you will get the link token, so you\'ll be able to edit it!'
  - question: "How do I use a link token?"
    answer: 'When logged in on your dashboard click: "Add link", paste the token in the textbox and click "Redeem link", and you\'ll be able to edit that link!'
  - question: "Why can I only use Discord to login?"
    answer: 'We only support Discord because that doesn't give us any of your personal information like e-mail or name and surname. We won\'t be supporting other login systems like Google, Twitter or Facebook. We don\'t want your data, because we would need bigger databases, and I don\'t really want to spend a lot of money for databases...'
